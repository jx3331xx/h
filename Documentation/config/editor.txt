editor.stty::
	A boolean variable that tells git to save and restore its
	terminal settings when the editor is invoked, to avoid
	being affected by garbled input/output, if it misbehaves.
+
It defaults to 'true' if your editor is "vi" (which is
also the default if there is no `core.editor`), or to
'false' otherwise.
